The blake2b_simd and blake2s_simd code comes from the "cortex-m0-benches"
branch of https://github.com/oconnor663/blake2_simd, specifically
https://github.com/oconnor663/blake2_simd/commit/ebec83dfdd0e3b46e8dda350c05ea60a405e1c83.
This branch removes inline(always) directives for the portable implementation
of BLAKE2b, which hurt performance on ARM Cortex-M0, presumably for cache size
reasons. Most implementations of BLAKE2b always do this inlining, including
OpenSSL, so the performance of BLAKE2b on ARM Cortex-M0 in these benchmarks is
better than in most real-world applications. (Still substantially worse than
BLAKE2s on that platform, of course.)

The "baokeshed" crate is a prototype implementation of BLAKE3 with a silly
name.
